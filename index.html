                        source of rain. They are most precious gift to the humanity on the earth from nature for which we
                        must be grateful, give honour and preserve for the mankind wellness. We should understand importance
                        of trees in our lives and do our best to save trees in order to save life, save environment on the
                        earth and make earth a green earth.

                    <p class="second-paragraph"> Trees are as valuable as gold that’s why they are called as “Green Gold” on the earth.
                        <span class="shadowed">They are the real source of our health as well as wealth because they give us oxygen, cool air, fruits,
                            spices, vegetables, medicines, water, wood, furniture, shadow, fuel to burn, houses, fodder to
                            animals and other useful things. They consume all the CO2, refresh air from toxic gases and prevent
                            us from the air pollution.</span>

                        every person living on the earth. It is a big opportunity to all of us to save our healthy environment
                        and green earth by saving trees. Trees are symbol of life on the earth and natural home for many
                        people and wild animals. Saving trees have been must at any cost in such a modern world where urbanization,
                        industrialization and global warming is going very fast. In such a technological world, where people
                        are fighting and working for themselves only, only trees are living for benefiting others (human
                        beings and animals).
